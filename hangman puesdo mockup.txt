	

variable array of words 
variable array of guessed letters


start with random variable number and store data assigned number output.

decisions:
	letter guessed before 
			compare against guess input variable 
				if already guessed warn and ask for next guess
				if not guessed then	
					compare guess to word:
						letter in word? 
							yes
								word complete?
								yes - win
							no - guess again? 
									if guesses greater then 12
									if guesses == 0 and no match user loses
win - if word string nut matches 

									
						
						letter not in word 
	
user guess to solve
	word solved? word compare true  
			word compare false	

user win:	
	string compare to word true match

user loses
	out of guesses and word not complete



	


guesses:  

	allow guess if guesses still greater then zero:
	guesses and decrements-
			
			no decrement if 
				right guess
				or wrong guess guessed before

			decrement 
				if no match to word.  count to counter variable 
				if guessCounter == 0 && string less then string length 								lose 
									on lose reset guessCounter 
									clear guesses
									select new word 
							

win 	
	word completed : before guesses run out
lose 
	word not completed and guesses run out. 

after each guess
	offer to user to solve or guess 
			if user chooses solve 
				input word compared to stored word
					if match to secret word- user wins and win message put to screen
					if if not a match and guesses still greater then allocated guesses ask for user for next guess
					
			user solves word 
			user selects to guess
